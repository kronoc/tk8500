tk8500 is open source software designed to control and
program the ICOM IC-R8500 receiver.

I implemented tk8500 in the Tcl/Tk scripting language which
enables it to run on a variety of operating systems,
including Linux, Microsoft Windows 98, and Windows XP.
The free Tcl/Tk interpreter software must be installed
on your computer prior to using tk8500.
I have not tested tk8500 on other platforms,
but it will probably work on them after little or no modification.

Installation instructions may be found on the web at

                          Notes


The Linux version of tk8500 presumes the wish windowing shell
is in your PATH.

Before using tk8500, be sure the IC-R8500's "initial set mode"
options are set as follows:

CIV ADDR = 4AH
CIV BAUD = AUTO
CIV TRAN = OFF
CIV 731 = OFF

See pp. 31 - 32 in the IC-R8500 instruction manual
to learn how to set them.

Power your IC-R8500 receiver on before starting tk8500
or else the program will freeze.
